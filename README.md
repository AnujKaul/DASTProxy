What is DAST Proxy
==================


DAST Proxy is a life cycle management tool for dynamic application security scans, with workflows that help users record browser actions and submit those to the backend scan engine like AppScan. It updates the user with the scan status and publishes the scan results. It supports automation integration and has a set of RESTful web services which can be seamlessly integrated into any existing Selenium (or any other automation framework) functional test cases for security testing. DAST Proxy also works with all the browser-based test cases for both web and mobile applications.

How Does DAST Proxy Work
========================

This section will explain how to conduct a manual dynamic security scan using the DAST Proxy. To start, the user will be required to have two browsers installed. On Browser 1, the user would obtain a proxy host and port generated by the DAST server on DAST Proxy’s homepage. The user would then insert this host and port into Browser 2’s proxy settings. Once the proxy is setup, DAST Proxy will record all the web traffic between Browser 2 and the QA server and will store them in a HAR file. The same file is then submitted to the backend scan engine for thorough dynamic security testing. DAST Proxy polls the backend engine for the status and resultant vulnerabilities and will store them in the DB which is accessible to the user via the DAST Proxy dashboard.
